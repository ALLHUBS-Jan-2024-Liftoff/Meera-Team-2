GitHub Steps:

1. Convert Draft (from Backlog or Ready column in GitHub Project) to Issue.
2. Move issue from Backlog/Ready to In Progress.
3. Click on issue and scroll to Development section. Select "Create a branch".
4. Checkout new branch locally.
5. Work on Code.
6. Commit often.
7. Push when issue is complete.
8. Create Pull Request.

Reviewing Pull Requests

1. Review for functionality and bugs.
2. Merge pull request with main branch.
3. Let everyone know an issue has been merged with main branch.
4. On local, run "git fetch origin", "git merge main". (This is the one I'm most unsure about. I don't know if we have to checkout main, run git pull, checkout the branch we were working on and then run "git merge main".)
